The interview turned into a three day stay at Johnny Rotten's west London flat, in which Benain captured Johnny Rotten, the band's bassist, Sid Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, hanging out - with other members of London's punk scene dropping by. Six months later Nancy Spungen was found dead in the New York hotel room she shared with Sid Vicious. He was charged with her murder and soon after died of a heroin overdose. Two photos from the session, showing Sid Vicious playing with a knife and holding it under his girlfriend's throat, were splashed across a number of publications worldwide, following the dramatic developments. Most of the remaining photos have remained unpublished. They are now the subject of the exhibition, Never Mind The Sex Pistols, at Snap Galleries in London.Presenter: @bbcdandamonProduced by: @ibrimExhibition here: https://www.snapgalleries.com/exhibitions/Subscribe to BBC News HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUogCheck out our website: http://www.bbc.com/newsFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/bbcworldnewsTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/bbcworldInstagram: http://instagram.com/bbcnews",01/29/2016,116,BBC News,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kNViDMEcmtI/hqdefault.jpg,sex+pistols+sex pistols+punk+music+sid vicious+Johnny Rotten+Pierre Benain+Actuel+photos+images+photographs+Nancy Spungen+Never Mind The Sex Pistols+lifestyle+youtube+video+bbc+news+bbc news,Music,4.7933578491,55653,257,14,1920,1080,webm,248 - 1920x1080 (1080p)+251 - audio only (DASH audio),opus,vp9,0,0,20
