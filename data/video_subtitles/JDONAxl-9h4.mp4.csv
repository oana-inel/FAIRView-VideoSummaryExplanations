JDONAxl-9h4,0,"Well, basically El Nino is a warming of the Pacific Ocean which has a major impact on weather around the world. Usually easterly trade winds blow warm Waters towards the West Pacific with cold water welling up now the west coast of South America but El Nino forms when temperatures in the Central and Eastern tropical Pacific are at least half a degree higher than normal for several months this occurs. When a burst of Westerly winds in the West Pacific sets in motion a large and slow moving wave the rapidly warms the ocean just beneath the surface. This is what has happened early this year a sea surface temperatures rise. El Nino can form this ocean warming usually last about a year and is part of a complex cycle linking atmosphere and ocean which happens every two to seven years. So what can this Pacific warming mean?
