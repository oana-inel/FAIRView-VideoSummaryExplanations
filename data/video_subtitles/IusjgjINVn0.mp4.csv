IusjgjINVn0,0,We take a look at this video. Everyone sitting there fine right here is the crucial point the girl touched the hand rail. I'm gonna explain why that's important is second. You see the father whoever this man is jump back for a second then get her out and then you see a girl there as you point out Chris everybody is okay at the end of this the grandfather here comes over gets her out as well at this point. He may have gotten a little bit of electrical charge himself there. He falls backwards. There's a couple of important points here. The water is was likely electrified. We know that kids are swimming just fine. But at the time this girl touches the handrail essentially she becomes the ground we think of electricity we think of it going to ground. She now becomes the ground. It's flowing through her body into that handrail and that's why she becomes limp like that. He touches the handrail for a second same sort of thing happens.

He may have gotten a little bit of electrical charge himself there. He falls backwards. There's a couple of important points here. The water is was likely electrified. We know that kids are swimming just fine. But at the time this girl touches the handrail essentially she becomes the ground we think of electricity we think of it going to ground. She now becomes the ground. It's flowing through her body into that handrail and that's why she becomes limp like that. He touches the handrail for a second same sort of thing happens.
