I'm glad you raised that and it's a critical issue. I think it's not just an economic issue. I think it's a moral issue I think is frankly not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives and the amount of debt were adding at a trillion a year is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically there are three ways that you can cut it at a deficit one, of course is to to raise taxes that number two is to cut spending and number three is to grow the economy because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes and you can get the job done that way the president's would present with prefer raising taxes.
