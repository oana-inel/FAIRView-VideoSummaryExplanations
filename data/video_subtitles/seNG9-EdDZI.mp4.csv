But what is this polar vortex? What does it actually mean to you and me and where is it found? Well, let's address. First of all what the polar vortex is. It's normally recognized as a huge chunk of atmosphere frigid atmosphere rotating around 30 kilometers above our head in the stratosphere. It spins because our planet spins and it's called the polar vortex because it sits over the polar region.
