JrsvLOSb6GQ,0," Disappointed supporters of Governor Oaxaca telling him to continue his race for re-election the incumbent Governor himself also said that being declared a suspect by police in a blasphemy case doesn't mean he will drop out of the race. I hope this legal case is not only about Governor a hawk. But this is about the unity of Indonesia. We're convinced that everyone should be equal in the face of the law. Well, he's has declared a hawk a suspect after he questioned the use of a quranic verse the verse called Almeida deals with the leadership of non-muslims over Muslims consecuencia. The result is that this case will now go to the next level of the investigation.
