dfM5jnXQBk4,0," Yeah, super Heidi Fred Heidi Klum went from super model to Super Mom this weekend. She was vacationing in Oahu Hawaii on Sunday with her family when her oldest son. Henry was swept into a large Riptide along with two nannies now Klum and her bodyguard boyfriend quickly reacted. They race to save her seven-year-old son and caretakers from drowning while fans are calling her a hero in a statement to CNN. She says she was just being a mom. Here's what she said to us. She said we were pulled into the ocean by a big wave like any mother. I was very scared for my child and everyone else in the water. Thankfully Henry is a strong swimmer and was able to swim back to land and we were able to get everyone out safely. I can only imagine Fred I don't have kids but I can only imagine how frightening that must have been. Hopefully though. She can get a little R&R for the rest of this vacation. Yeah. I think she developed a little superhuman strength that kind of happens at kicks in with a mom.",0.7453389763832092,28.4,28.6,"Yeah,",2
