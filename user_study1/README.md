# FAIRView Corpus: Visual Explanations for Video Summaries

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/)

This repository contains:
 * 200 [videos](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/video_dataset_content.csv) machine annotated with key concepts extracted from video subtitles and video frames;
 * 800 [video summaries](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/video_summaries)  (four summaries per video) machine annotated with concepts extracted from video subtitles and frames;
 * 3200 [visual explanations](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/visual_explanations) (four explanations per video summary with different levels of *transparency*):
   * semantic coverage,
   * semantic prominence
   * quantity coverage
   * distance
 * human validated **utility** of each visual explanation type ([mTurk crowdsourcing study_1](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/user_study1/user_study1_template.md) with 20 videos and single summary)
 * human validated **representativeness** of video summaries with regard to their original videos ([mTurk crowdsourcing study_2](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/user_study2/user_study2_template.md) with 18 videos with 2 summaries per video). In total 36 video-summary pairs

## User Study 1

This online user study, [User Study 1](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/user_study1/user_study1_template.md), has been conducted in order to identify which type of visual explanation is preferred when assessing the representativeness of video summaries.
