# FAIRView Corpus: Visual Explanations for Video Summaries

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/)

This repository contains:
 * 200 [videos](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/video_dataset_content.csv) machine annotated with key concepts extracted from video subtitles and video frames;
 * 800 [video summaries](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/video_summaries)  (four summaries per video) machine annotated with concepts extracted from video subtitles and frames;
 * 3200 [visual explanations](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/data/visual_explanations) (four explanations per video summary with different levels of *transparency*):
   * semantic coverage,
   * semantic prominence
   * quantity coverage
   * distance
 * human validated **utility** of each visual explanation type ([mTurk crowdsourcing study_1](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/user_study1/user_study1_template.md) with 20 videos and single summary)
 * human validated **representativeness** of video summaries with regard to their original videos ([mTurk crowdsourcing study_2](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/blob/master/user_study2/user_study2_template.md) with 18 videos with 2 summaries per video). In total 36 video-summary pairs

## User Studies

The following online user studies have been conducted in order to evaluate the utility of four types of visual explanations:
 - [User Study 1](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/user_study1/user_study1_template.md): identify which type of visual explanation is preffered when assessing the representativeness of video summaries
 - [User Study 2](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/user_study2/user_study2_template.md): understand how one type of visual explanation is used by participants when asked to compare two summaries of the same video for their representativeness

## Machine Annotation of Videos and Video summaries

We used three enrichment tools for machine the annotations:
* [video transcription](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/transcription)
* [named entity extraction](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities)
* [video labeling](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-labels)

If you want to regenerate the results of the machine enrichment tools used for the machine annotation of both original videos and video summaries you need to register for the following Google Cloud APIs and follow their instructions. A schelethon notebook for running each of the APIs below is provided in the notebooks/machine_processing folder.
 * [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) - Google Cloud Storage
 * [Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/transcription) - part of Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to transcribe the videos (extraction captions or subtitles)
 * [Label Detection](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-labels) - part of Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to detect and extract information about entities shown in video and video summaries
 * [Entity Extraction](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities) - part of Google Cloud Natural Language to extract entities from the video subtitles
