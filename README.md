# FAIRView Corpus: Visual Explanations for Video Summaries

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/)

This repository contains:
 * 200 videos machine annotated with key concepts extracted from video subtitles and video frames;
 * 800 video summaries (four summaries per video) machine annotated with concepts extracted from video subtitles and frames;
 * 3200 visual explanations (four explanations per video summary with different levels of *transparency*):
   * semantic coverage,
   * semantic prominence
   * quantity coverage
   * distance
 * human validated utility of each visual explanation type (mTurk crowdsourcing study 1)
 * human validated representativeness of video summaries with regard to their original videos (mTurk crowdsourcing study 2)


All results are published in the following paper:

## User Studies

The following online user studies have been conducted in order to evaluate the utility of four types of visual explanations:
 - [User Study 1](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/user_study1/user_study1_template.md): identify which type of visual explanation is preffered when assessing the representativeness of video summaries
 - [User Study 2](https://github.com/oana-inel/FAIRView-VideoSummaryExplanations/user_study2/user_study2_template.md): understand how one type of visual explanation is used by participants when asked to compare two summaries of the same video for their representativeness

## Video Machine Enrichment

To regenerate the results of the machine enrichment tools, namely the video transcription, named entity extraction and video labeling, you need to register for the following Google Cloud APIs and follow their instructions. A schelethon notebook for running each of the APIs below is provided in the notebooks/machine_processing folder.
 * [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) - Google Cloud Storage
 * [Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/transcription) - part of Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to transcribe the videos (extraction captions or subtitles)
 * [Label Detection](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/analyze-labels) - part of Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to detect and extract information about entities shown in video and video summaries
 * [Entity Extraction](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-entities) - part of Google Cloud Natural Language to extract entities from the video subtitles
